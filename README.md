# Algorithmic Factors Influencing Bias in Machine Learning

William Blanzeisky, PÃ¡draig Cunningham

Abstract: It is fair to say that many of the prominent examples of biasin Machine Learning (ML) arise from bias in the training data. In fact,some would argue that supervised ML algorithmscannotbe biased, theyreflect the data on which they are trained. In this paper, we demonstratehow ML algorithms can misrepresent the training data through underestimation. We show how irreducible error, regularization, and feature and class imbalance can contribute to this underestimation. The paper concludes with a demonstration of how the careful management of synthetic counterfactuals can ameliorate the impact of this underestimation bias.
